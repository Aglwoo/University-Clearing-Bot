Currently in the process of converting the program into an application

The program uses the names of universities you would like to apply for and searches them for any available courses with the key words you have inputed. The result of the program running can be seen in the different folders.
The program searches through the complete university guide due to its website structure being easy to navigate quickly.
However it is important to note that TUG can be wrong sometimes and takes slightly longer to update than UCAS.

Also some universities prefer to not put their course on the UCAS website and instead only put them up on the website. (This is very rare though)
